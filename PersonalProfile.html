<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test ">Myers-Briggs Test Link  </a>
<p>According to the Myers-Briggs test my results showed that my personality type is a Logistician type.</p>
<p>The Logistician personality type is thought to be the most abundant, making up around 13% of the population. Their defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make Logisticians a vital core to many families, as well as organizations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. People with the Logistician personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions, and take pride in the work they do – when working towards a goal, Logisticians hold back none of their time and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience.</p>

<p>Logisticians don’t make many assumptions, preferring instead to analyze their surroundings, check their facts and arrive at practical courses of action. Logistician personalities are no-nonsense, and when they’ve made a decision, they will relay the facts necessary to achieve their goal, expecting others to grasp the situation immediately and take action. Logisticians have little tolerance for indecisiveness, but lose patience even more quickly if their chosen course is challenged with impractical theories, especially if they ignore key details – if challenges becomes time-consuming debates, Logisticians can become noticeably angry as deadlines tick nearer.</p>

<p>According to the Learning Style test my results showed that my learning stype type is a Visual type.</p>
<h3>Visual</h3>

<p>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.</p>

<p>As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>

<h3> My Results? </h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">These 3 test results don't suprise me as on the whole the tests do reflect my personality , learning style and how I work in a team .I have also numerous personality traits that according to the tests results I do not share and other ways in which I differ when learning and working in a team . However these test results do form a good base on which I can reflect.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">As a logistician personality type my contributions to a team would be greatly beneficial as the defining characterisitics are integrity , practical logic and tireless dedication to duty . This personality type in my opinion would be a core member of any sucessful team . The test suggests that I can become noticeably angry as deadlines tick nearer if challenges were to become time-consuming debates .While previously working in teams I found this to not be the case as I found I would push other team members to make a deadline but never became angry and I would also help in any way I could .</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">I do find it easier to learn by visual methods so working in a group and being able to " see " what we are doing and collabarating on makes it a lot easier for me to become involved and contribute to my full extent .The test suggests that I may be distracted by sounds but I don't tend to find this the case , due to having to work and concentrate in noisy and busy environments in the past .</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">While I do prefer to work on my own I am also capable of easily working effectively in any team role . I am patient and value input from each team member while trying to implement my own ideas .The test suggests I can effectively resolve conflicts with team mates .I don't think this part is accurate as I really dislike any type of conflict and will generally steer well clear of them .</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">I can be stuborn if I think an idea is better then another one but will relent if the majority of the team believes that the other idea is better . This is something I need to be aware of when working in a group and try to avoid dominating decision making in regards to accepting other ideas . Having been in the military , working sucessfully in a team is considered mandatory and being able to work with each person's skills and personality is something I naturally find easy to do  . I am happy to work in any role in a team and will use my skills and abilities to complete any project .
