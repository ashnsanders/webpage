<p> https://www.seek.com.au/job/41364934?type=standout#searchRequestToken=1a2d494e-fb25-45a1-a3aa-018990c42ddb</p>

<p>My ideal job would be to work as a help desk engineer . It would allow me to use my skills in IT to trouble shoot and fix problems for clients both face to face and over the phone . This is something I enjoy doing and would suit my personality and aptitude for practical skills developed during my training as both an aircraft mechanical engineer and diesel fitter . I am more interested in the application of practical skills than theory although I recognise the need for relevant background knoweledge.</p>

<p>The skills, qualifications and experience required for this job would be to have good oral and written skills , good inter-personal skills to be able to  deal with clients and co-workers , the ability to trouble shoot and come up with solutions to fit the client's needs , hardwear and softwear trouble shooting skills encluding VoIP, ability to manage time and multitask and experience working with a variety of softwear and hardwear . The Softwear use I would need experience in for this position includes Microsoft Office , Microsoft Office 365 Admin , MYOB , Reckon , QuickBooks , Windows Server Active Directory and Group Policy , IT Glue , Veeam , StorageCraft , Yealink and Grandstream .</p>

<p>While I currently have good oral and written skills , good inter-personal skills and the ability to manage time and multitask ,  I have limited knoweledge of the technical skills and relevant background information required for this position .</p>

<p>To gain the  skills, qualifications and experience that I would require to be able to trouble shoot and come up with solutions to fit the clients' needs I would need experience in that area from working in an entry level position utilising similar softwear and hardwear. I would require experience in trouble shooting hardwear and softwear which I intend to gain from the entry level position . This degree will give me exposure to some of the softwear required and the background knowelege and framework which I currently do not have and will allow me to grain an entry level position , while giving me general knowledge in all other aspects of the IT industry as a whole . The units Introduction to Computer Systems , Security in Computing and IT and Softwear Engineering Fundamentals for IT specifically will help me in achieving the required level of skills needed for this position.
