<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:300%;">My Project Idea </h1>

<p style="font-size:120%;"> <img src="https://github.com/ashnsanders/webpage/blob/master/9e9.gif?raw=true">My IT project Idea is to produce an App on Android and Iphone that will allow any one who has any first aid experience and has downloaded the app to have a step by step guide to doing CPR while using the DR ABCD method of first aid . The App would accomplish this using voice and txt/pictures . The App would " walk " the user through the process and ask a simple yes/no question at the end of each stage to determine what the next stage of DR ABCD should be. The App would be user friendly. Idealy the App would get input from either ST Johns Ambulance or Queensland Ambulance Service to approve the methods being used with a disclaimer to cover any legal issues that may arise due to it being medical in nature .</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">According to the 2007 Pfizer Health Report only 22% of people who suffer a sudden heart attack are given CPR before the arrival of an ambulance .If the reasons for this low percentage are because of a lack of knowledge or confidence in bystanders in using CPR an App that could help solve these two problems has the potential to save many lives.This app could provide a cheap and easily utilised solution to this problem .

<p style="font-size:120%;">The App would be an offline internet app meaning that you don't HAVE to connect to the internet to use the app apart from having to download the app itself. Any updates can be download with connection to the internet . This allows the App to be used anywhere regardless of access to the internet. Being on both Android and Iphone it should allow the app to be used on all current smart phones and even tablets which allows some flexability in your choice of mobile device. There will be no  special user input like having to log-in required - as soon as you start the app the programme will start . Nor will the app require any user settings like volume control or brightness etc as that can be controled from the mobile device its self . This makes the app easy to use and non-distracting as the content being voiced and shown is what is important allowing the user to concentrate on what they are doing . The user input is minimal , just answering a simple yes/no question by tapping the appropriate answer at the end of each step in The DR ABCD method .The app directs the user to the appropriate next step according to the answer . The user thus determines the timing interval of the steps of the app and allows them to progress to the next step when necessary. It means that the user is in total control at all times while still being guided by the app  .The first aider can concentrate on what the App is telling them to do and avoid distractions and confusion by progressing only when the previous step has been completed to the user's satisfaction . The App has audio instructions as well as having txt/pictures to cater to the hard of hearing , and makes the app suitable for use in noisy conditions where relying on the audio instructions might be difficult. The txt/pictures would be easy to read with clear, large and bright lettering allowing it to be used in conditions of low light. The language used will be clear, concise and easily understood for both the audio and txt . This makes each step simple and as straight forward as possible so as not to confuse the user to help boost confidence . The app will include an audio tempo and visual representation of the timing required for CPR either working on your own , or working in tandem . While the App is mainly designed to be used as an aid to first aiders it can also be used by anyone not trained in first aid as the instructions are simple to follow . The app is meant to be " Basic " so anyone and everyone can use it easily. At a later date this app could cater for other languages and be extended to include other situations requiring different types of first aid . </p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">The softwear needed to make this app for Android and Iphone should be a cross platform one and would need to be something like C++ Builder as it has the ability to make apps for both Iphone and Android as well as allowing voice and pictures/txt . There is no need for any special hardwear as it should be able to be made on any PC that can run C++ Builder .The voice component will need a voice capture softwear such as Audacity with a normal PC mic which will be more then enough . The txt component can be produced using softwear like Microsoft Edge . The pictures can either be created with a programme like Animaker or taken from exsisting first aid pictures ( taking into account Copyright  etc ) .You would aslo need an expert consultant in first aid and CPR using the DR ABCD method to cover any legal issues . The App itself once completed can be uploaded to Google Play ( Android ) for $25 for a one off payment and App Store ( Iphone ) for $99/year to enable the App to be distributed to the widest user base . </p>

<p style="font-size:120%;"><img src="https://github.com/ashnsanders/webpage/blob/master/phone.gif?raw=true">The skills needed to use the softwear for this  project apart from the C++ Builder are fairly straight forward and anyone with IT knowledge should be able to produce those components ( Audacity,Microsoft Edge and Animaker ) but bringing it all together and producing the App would require a person with experience with C++ Builder. This part of the production would need to be out sourced to someone with the relevant experence working with C++. A first aid trainer or a consult from St Johns Ambulance/Queensland Ambulance Service  would be able to supply the relevent information on CPR and the DR ABCD method. For legal issues we would need to consult with a lawyer specialising in medico-legal matters .</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">If this App were to become successful I could envision it being given to not only anyone having completed a first aid course but also anyone who could potentially need to conduct CPR , for example defence force members or taxi drivers . As the App is a step by step process of DR ABCD it should remove a lot of the confusion around conducting CPR. This would give users a lot more confidence and the ability to conduct CPR with no need of prior knowledge . This has the potential result of facilitating fewer preventable deaths , and removing a degree of stress from what is an already traumatic situation.      </p>
