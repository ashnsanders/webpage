<p style="font-size:120%;"><img top left src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/e4d613ee59e79b93e38ec2521cce19e4/tenor.gif?itemid=5751430 style="width:60px;height:60px;"> My interest in IT  started when my family got our first computer which was an Amstrad and I found out we could use the computer to play computer games on as well as using it to print and write documents . In the "good old days" you had to used command promts etc to get games to start and trouble shoot if it wouldn't run , nothing like just clicking an icon and having the programme run . I enjoy being able to use my limlited knowelege fixing hardwear and softwear issues . I find it interesting how there has been a continual leap in computing technology over the years and the improvements in gaming due to the new hardwear and softwear that is available. It's also interesting how gameing became a worldwide industry with complex games that can take a gamer 100's of hours to complete . Luckly I am now in a situation where I can learn about IT and to hopefully make it into a career .</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">I chose to study at RMIT due to the good reputation the university has not only in Australia but also internationally . My Open Universities Australia adviser also recommended RMIT saying that it has one of the best IT courses available with really good learning resources and a great learning environment . RMIT allows me to complete my studies at a time during the day that suits me and having all the online lectures at night allows me to work durinig the day therefore making it financially viable to complete this course .</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">During my studies I hope to learn all of the aspects needed to sucessfully work in the IT industry as IT is now such an important part of every day life. These studies will improve and expand the limited  IT skills I already have and teach me new skills like programming and group presentation . I hope to meet and interact with new and interesting people , learning from their experiences and IT skills and being able to incorporate them with my own to become a well rounded IT professional .
