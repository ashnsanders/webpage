<p> Hi , I'm Ashley but everyone calls me Ash . I finished year 12 at Downlands College in Toowoomba after having completed all the building and hands on classes I could find .
 I joined the Airforce as an Apprentice Aircraft Mechanical Engineer and I spent the first 14 months in Wagga Wagga NSW learning all the basics about fixing aircraft and relevant military training.
 Having completed the fitter training and ready to go into the " real " Airforce I was posted to 1 Squadron at Amberley Airforce base ( near Ipswich Qld ) to work on the F-111's strike aircraft .
 While I was posted to 1 sqn I was deployed on exercises all around Australia but luckily for me I did not have to go overseas  .
 I spent close to 6 years in the Airforce but I decided that I wanted to have a bit more of a normal life and that it was time to move on and do something different .
 I moved back home and started an apprenticeship in diesel fitting with the Toowoomba Regional council but after 3 years of coming home covered in black oil every day I decided that wasn't for me either.
 I then moved to Hervey Bay with my parents and helped them to build their retirement home overlooking the sea and Fraser Island .
 I started working as a road traffic controller dealing with the public and road construction crews ,  which I really enjoyed . After 6 years of standing in the heat and cold  Covid-19 hit and work started to slow down .
 This gave me the perfect opportunity to enrol in an IT degree with RMIT .  I have always been an avid gamer , mainly gaming on PC but occasionally on consoles as well  .
 Currently I am playing " World of Warcraft Classic " , " Escape from Tarkov " and have started the  "Final Fantasy 7 remake "  . I enjoy reading historical fiction based on  Roman and Mediaevil times.
 I find it fascinating learning about their daily lives and the struggles they have to over come  .  I have a 4 year old female cat called Misty that loves to sit on my PC Tower and supervise everything I do .</p>
